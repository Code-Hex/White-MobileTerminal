Hello everyone :D  
Supports ios versions from 7.0 to  8.1 !!  
  
Changed UI(Cooler than before).  
Fixed some issues(for example: problems when restarting subprocesses).  
Completely removed the black line on the screen.  
(This problem is only solved in whiteterminal for now.)  
Added fonts setting controller!!  
Added themes setting controller!!  
I've prepared 10 types of fonts and limitless color themes :D
